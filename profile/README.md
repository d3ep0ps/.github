# 🌌 d3ep0ps — Depth Over Hype

> A calm, noise-free space for individuals who want to understand technology deeply, not just use it.

Welcome to **d3ep0ps**.  
My name is **Vitaliy Zhhuta** — a System & Solution Architect by profession and a physicist by education.  
I like building systems that make sense — from packets on the wire to machine-learning models in the cloud.

Here, you'll find practical labs, configuration guides, and automation snippets designed to help you **learn by doing**.

## 🧠 The Roadmap

We cover the full stack of modern infrastructure:

*   **Foundation:** Linux / FreeBSD administration, shell discipline, and security habits
*   **Networking:** IPv4/IPv6, VLANs, routers, DNS, VPNs/WireGuard, monitoring
*   **Self-Hosting:** Mail, reverse proxies, and automation for small services
*   **Cloud:** Deploying and managing workloads on GCP, Kubernetes, and hybrid setups
*   **Automation:** Infrastructure-as-Code, CI/CD, observability, and agents
*   **AI & ML:** Connecting everything you learned to build intelligent systems that adapt and optimize

Each lab complements articles on [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@d3ep0ps) and [**d3ep0ps.com**](https://d3ep0ps.com).

## 🌍 Philosophy

> “We don’t just run commands — we understand them.”

No hype, no shortcuts.  
Just deep, simple, hands-on learning for real engineers.
